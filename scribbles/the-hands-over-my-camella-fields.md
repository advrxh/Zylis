Lifeless cry of a bleeding soul,<br/>Endless beds of dancing ole. <br/>Reds and blues and the sunset hues,<br/>Guarding all, her faceless hands.<br/><br/>Sculpted in clay, her hands so cold.<br/>Cloaked in haze, her heart of gold. <br/>Veiled in malaise, her words of ode. <br/>Lost in grey, our secrets so old. <br/><br/>Adrift, in the never-ending fields, <br/>Of the enchanting pink Camellas. <br/>Aloof, in the ever-lasting caress,<br/>Of her endearing warm hands. <br/><br/>Hiding behind the bitter petals, <br/>Of a painful false pretense. <br/>Burdened by the belittling ache, <br/>Of an ancient fairy tale.<br/><br/>On the face of the pink fields, <br/>Through the haze of the sweet breeze. <br/>Her hands heal the once lost and torn, <br/>Bringing solace to the soul forlorn. <br/><br/>*- Aadil Varsh*
