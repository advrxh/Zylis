<pre>
Gazed back at the ghats, 
with the sunken sun behind.
Took only a tilt-up,
To see what I left behind.

There it stood-still, 
Like a silver stud. 
Alone and beyond-
The reach of my mind.

Browsed through the skies,
Of the days and the nights.
Have I forgotten? 
The goodnight stars. 

Six, seven, eight. 
I lost count. 
"They never end", said, 
The arm that I held. 

The frozen crystal, 
Never was still. 
It's gentle quiver, 
Underlined my fear, 
To forget. 

To not to be forgotten.
