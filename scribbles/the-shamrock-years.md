Plucked from my comfort,<br/>Stuck close to my closest. <br/>Was a wonder trip down land, <br/>Leaving myself up far. <br/>Lost, I did, left him afar. <br/>Wove, I did, a brilliant avatar.<br/><br/>My shadow and scores, <br/>were the shamrock roofs. <br/>There I saw, Under the shades, <br/>a stream of stars, hiding alike. <br/>Travelled the years, <br/>pacing along the stars. <br/>Some shone bright, Some stay put, <br/>Some I held, right and tight.<br/><br/>In a flash, not so long before, <br/>A stupid thought. <br/>There I leave behind, a decade of shamrock. <br/>Neither a graceful adieu, Nor a gentle kiss. <br/>Struck by a feeling, Guilty, am I? <br/><br/><br/>*- Aadil Varsh*
