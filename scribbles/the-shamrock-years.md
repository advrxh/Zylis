Plucked from my comfort,
Stuck close to my closest. 
Was a wonder trip down land, 
Leaving myself up far. 
Lost, I did, left him afar. 
Wove, I did, a brilliant avatar.

My shadow and scores, 
were the shamrock roofs. 
There I saw, Under the shades, 
a stream of stars, hiding alike. 
Travelled the years, 
pacing along the stars. 
Some shone bright, Some stay put, 
Some I held, right and tight.

In a flash, not so long before, 
A stupid thought. 
There I leave behind, a decade of shamrock. 
Neither a graceful adieu, Nor a gentle kiss. 
Struck by a feeling, Guilty, am I?
