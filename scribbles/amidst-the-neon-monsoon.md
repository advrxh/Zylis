<pre>
A stranger behind the screen,
Instilled in me, a dream.
Not to reach the moon, 
Not to ride the storm.

But,
To stand among a crowd,
And feel the rain pour-down.
While a million lives appeared, 
On each drop upside-down. 

The speeding trains hadn't changed, 
But the stalls beneath spoke less. 
Had the indices lied? 'Cause, 
It wasn't same as the fine reels. 

A dozen images flashing per second. 
Striking neons bled through the lens. 
Pouring raindrops offered me a cold-kiss, 
The blurry palette had put me in a dream.
