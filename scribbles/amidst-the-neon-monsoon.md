<br/>A stranger behind the screen,<br/>Instilled in me, a dream.<br/>Not to reach the moon, <br/>Not to ride the storm.<br/><br/>But,<br/>To stand among a crowd,<br/>And feel the rain pour-down.<br/>While a million lives appeared, <br/>On each drop upside-down. <br/><br/>The speeding trains hadn't changed, <br/>But the stalls beneath spoke less. <br/>Had the indices lied? 'Cause, <br/>It wasn't same as the fine reels. <br/><br/>A dozen images flashing per second. <br/>Striking neons bled through the lens. <br/>Pouring raindrops offered me a cold-kiss, <br/>The blurry palette had put me in a dream. <br/><br/>*- Aadil Varsh*
