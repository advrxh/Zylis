The skies heaved, sound and sound.<br/>The crows swirled, round and round. <br/>Was it the rain? Or Was it the faint, or<br/>Was it the pain, that's back again?<br/><br/>Down there, there-in-there,<br/>Shade took over the fair.<br/>Where lovers swayed through their days,<br/>in a haze. <br/><br/>"Darling, won't you stay?" as, <br/>he say, <br/><br/>The burden of the skies,<br/>hurled down the trees,<br/>floors past floors, <br/>down into the seas. <br/><br/>Before she could say, <br/><br/>She saw, down there, <br/>round and round. <br/>A ripple on the ground. <br/>Etched by the rain, <br/>born from pain. <br/><br/>With its crests and troughs, <br/>the ripple took to the seas, <br/>a book of dreams, <br/>ever untold. <br/><br/>By him. <br/><br/>*- Aadil Varsh*
