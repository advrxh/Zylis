Away the sun, hid deep beneath the seas. 
The short hand slid, a bit past two.
It lays there, the huge numb glob.
Wide awake, this useless speck.

Silent echoes, hit walls of its home.
Suddenly, a knock.
An inaudible hum, let the knocker in. 
The inanimate residents, logged the strange aroma. 

The smell of warmth, strange to its home. 
Memories of day one, flogged right back. 
It lost its whole, into the lockless feathers. 
"Oh, how I've dreamt of this", it screamed.

A tilt into comfort, it opened its eyes. 
Ahead it saw, the world beyond the shiny plane.
Where does it lie, the world bore this question. 
Though we know, it went on dreaming. 

Forever, for its sanity.
