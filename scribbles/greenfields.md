On a mellow Monday,
Cladding a stout yellow array.
I walked into a cozy slate,
To humor an evil date.
Unaware. 

As many shallow barren faces,
Slowly crept inside my dreams.
Misplaced and two faced, 
Her two fine dimples shined. 
Unfazed.

Somewhere inside the green walls,
Somewhen during the small walks.
Some strange shimmering feeling, is it
Some strange spell of the daring?
Unwinding.

Then broke one Friday dawn, 
Of the final word showdown. 
A horse by the greenfields, 
Posed the bold white leaves. 

Where does it stand? 
Unscathed.
