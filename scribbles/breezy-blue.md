<pre>
Amid the hills, where secrets lie,
In breezy blue, under the sky.
With rain's caress, a tender trance,
They dance slow, a fleeting dance.

A stumble comes, a hasty retreat,
Seeking solace, where hills meet.
Accidents unfold, a silent plea,
In nature's grasp, they believe. 

Twilight whispers, shadows near,
Their minds entwined, no need to fear.
Night unfolds, a quiet embrace,
Two souls standing, face to face.

Yet hope weaves its intricate thread,
A path uncertain, where they may tread.
Clad in blue, her true grace shone,
In the breezy blue, love's overthrown.

Echoes linger in time's embrace,
A story carved, in time and space.
In hearts and hills, it shall remain, 
a breezy blue. 
</pre>
