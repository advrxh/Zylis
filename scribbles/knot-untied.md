In the deep blues,<br/>of my heart's cinemas.<br/>I see your merry laugh.<br/>Garlanding, your shrine.<br/>Your dear face, <br/>my life's dear grace.<br/><br/>Amidst the grey crowd,<br/>of the children of our dear God.<br/>I seek your sweet-smelling strands,<br/>Slipping from your white silver dress.<br/><br/>I hold your warm cherry hands, and<br/>let my heart do a little dance.<br/>I ask your angels for a chance, and<br/>let my lips slip into a little trance.<br/><br/>To leave the edge of comfort,<br/>Beneath your shrine of gold.<br/>To lock the ends of a promise,<br/>Behind your shrine of gold.<br/><br/>I must rip the fabric of light,<br/>With the overwhelming might,<br/>of your emptiness in sight.<br/><br/>And here I leave your light,<br/>For a forever flying flight.<br/>While the creases remains,<br/>From a knot untied.<br/><br/><br/>*- Aadil Varsh*
