On a mellow Monday,<br/>Cladding a stout yellow array.<br/>I walked into a cozy slate,<br/>To humor an evil date.<br/>Unaware. <br/><br/>As many shallow barren faces,<br/>Slowly crept inside my dreams.<br/>Misplaced and two faced, <br/>Her two fine dimples shined. <br/>Unfazed.<br/><br/>Somewhere inside the green walls,<br/>Somewhen during the small walks.<br/>Some strange shimmering feeling, is it<br/>Some strange spell of the daring?<br/>Unwinding.<br/><br/>Then broke one Friday dawn, <br/>Of the final word showdown. <br/>A horse by the greenfields, <br/>Posed the bold white leaves. <br/><br/>Where does it stand? <br/>Unscathed. <br/><br/><br/>*- Aadil Varsh*
