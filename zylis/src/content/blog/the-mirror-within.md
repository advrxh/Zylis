Need no mirror, to see yourself. <br/>You are within, alive as the rattling rain. <br/>Sees the way ahead, <br/>the one residing rent free. <br/>Trouble's at the end of the road. <br/>To the right, says the "Good". <br/>To the left, says the "Bad". <br/>Turn to the rad or the amiss, <br/>tells the reflection. <br/><br/>*- Aadil Varsh *
