Amid the hills, where secrets lie,<br/>In breezy blue, under the sky.<br/>With rain's caress, a tender trance,<br/>They dance slow, a fleeting dance.<br/><br/>A stumble comes, a hasty retreat,<br/>Seeking solace, where hills meet.<br/>Accidents unfold, a silent plea,<br/>In nature's grasp, they believe. <br/><br/>Twilight whispers, shadows near,<br/>Their minds entwined, no need to fear.<br/>Night unfolds, a quiet embrace,<br/>Two souls standing, face to face.<br/><br/>Yet hope weaves its intricate thread,<br/>A path uncertain, where they may tread.<br/>Clad in blue, her true grace shone,<br/>In the breezy blue, love's overthrown.<br/><br/>Echoes linger in time's embrace,<br/>A story carved, in time and space.<br/>In hearts and hills, it shall remain, <br/>a breezy blue. <br/><br/>*- Aadil Varsh*
