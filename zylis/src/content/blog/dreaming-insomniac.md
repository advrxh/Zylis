Away the sun, hid deep beneath the seas. <br/>The short hand slid, a bit past two.<br/>It lays there, the huge numb glob.<br/>Wide awake, this useless speck.<br/><br/>Silent echoes, hit walls of its home.<br/>Suddenly, a knock.<br/>An inaudible hum, let the knocker in. <br/>The inanimate residents, logged the strange aroma. <br/><br/>The smell of warmth, strange to its home. <br/>Memories of day one, flogged right back. <br/>It lost its whole, into the lockless feathers. <br/>"Oh, how I've dreamt of this", it screamed.<br/><br/>A tilt into comfort, it opened its eyes. <br/>Ahead it saw, the world beyond the shiny plane.<br/>Where does it lie, the world bore this question. <br/>Though we know, it went on dreaming. <br/><br/>Forever, for its sanity. <br/><br/>*- Aadil Varsh*<br/>
