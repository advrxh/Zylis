I look past the grey,<br/>before the night's cold blue.<br/>It's only been a minute since,<br/>now I see a silhouette grow. <br/><br/>From, <br/>behind the curtain,<br/>the curtain of death.<br/><br/>As I search for the outlines, <br/>of her warm tender lips. <br/>Its shy sleek shadow, <br/>emerged from the shallow. <br/><br/>From, <br/>behind the curtain,<br/>the curtain of death. <br/><br/>A leap from comfort, <br/>leaving her earthly raw scent.<br/>I felt, Wounds from her past, <br/>reeking about her wrist. <br/><br/>From, <br/>behind the curtain, <br/>the curtain of death. <br/><br/>Why still?<br/>This gold laced needle. <br/>Why still? <br/>Weave this toile. <br/><br/>To stride the way, <br/>the only right way. <br/>To be present today. <br/><br/>*- Aadil Varsh*
