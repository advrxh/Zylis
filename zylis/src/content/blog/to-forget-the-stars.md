Gazed back at the ghats, <br/>with the sunken sun behind.<br/>Took only a tilt-up,<br/>To see what I left behind.<br/><br/>There it stood-still, <br/>Like a silver stud. <br/>Alone and beyond-<br/>The reach of my mind.<br/><br/>Browsed through the skies,<br/>Of the days and the nights.<br/>Have I forgotten? <br/>The goodnight stars. <br/><br/>Six, seven, eight. <br/>I lost count. <br/>"They never end", said, <br/>The arm that I held. <br/><br/>The frozen crystal, <br/>Never was still. <br/>It's gentle quiver, <br/>Underlined my fear, <br/>To forget. <br/><br/>To not to be forgotten. <br/><br/>*- Aadil Varsh*
